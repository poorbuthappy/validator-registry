    "overview": "Whispernode is a grassroots validator team that‚Äôs 100% focused on decentralization, security, & the cosmos ecosystem. We started with just one validator on Secret Network and have now grown to supporting 20+ Cosmos mainnet networks. We love the Web3 space and consider ourselves blessed to be able to do what we do everyday.",
    "team": "The WhisperNode team is comprised of 3 members - Brendan (founder), Nick (partner/software engineer), & gh0st (partner/sys admin). Combined, we have over 15+ years of experience in blockchain, and over 25+ years in the tech sector.",
    "security": "We strive to be incrementally better at what we do every single day, and thus reinvest a lot of our resources from delegators into improving WhisperNode (more on this below). WhisperNode works 24/7 to ensure that delegators can sleep peacefully, knowing their funds are #SAFU. We use TMKMS remote signers to ensure we NEVER double-sign, and run infrastructure across the globe to maintain a high level of decentralization + failover."
